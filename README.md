# Extra credit work:

# 1. Created a recommended products carousal that is controlled by two left-right chevron arrows. This is dynamically changed through JS.

# 2. Product details page updates for all 6 products aand the adding to cart functionality is fully functional for all products.

# 3. Interesting JS functionality: Hovering over the cart icon shows a pop-up with all the items in cart, the total, and ability to proceed to checkout.
